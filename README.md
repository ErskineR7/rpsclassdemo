# matchmaking

Coded with help from youtube video Juriy Bara's RPS game

This is to see what kind of match making system we want
We were considering a mmr style matchmaking, but that might be out of my depth.
This is a simple FIFO matchmaking where someone joins the server and the very next person that joins plays against him/her

I was thinking of taking this approach and using it for our project. 
This would not provide a useful solution to the Tournament portion of the project, but a passable
solution to the quick play portion.
